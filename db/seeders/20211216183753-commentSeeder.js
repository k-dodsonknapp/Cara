I personally think what he does is slightly worse just because there is a profit incentive in it for him instead of just going out for fun. If he is going to be making money off potentially endangering the public, I do have a very slight problem with that. If he does ever run over a cyclist on a blind corner, it is going to be a nightmare of a defense for his attorneys given the literally weeks of video evidence establishing a pattern. The thing is, he knows his family can afford the best legal defense for him if that does happen so part of the hate is probably just douchey rich kid entitlement.",

As I was driving up the trail I saw it widen into a bigger area before a steep incline, and a group of modified XJs were parked there. One guy was desperately trying to drive up the incline but kept sliding back down and everyone else was cheering him on and cracking up. Looked like a lot of fun. I asked if I could go ahead, and if they could spot me, because that guy sliding down the hill seemed kind of sketch and they said sure. ...And then my new and very unmodified wrangler toodled up the hill like it was a suburban neighborhood street.",
